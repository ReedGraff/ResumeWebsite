                                    <p><strong>Why would you want to be an entrepreneur?</strong><br><br>First of all, there’s a lot of excitement involved by following this path. Right. You’ll be working for yourself, starting your own business, and everyday, you’ll be waking up and thinking what can I do better for my business. What can I do to make sure that it runs faster, expand more, or get more customers. Unlike a job where you get paid the same amount every single month with the same schedule, your brain is always running and working. Elon Musk is a great example. This man dropped founded paypal, where he earned his first pot of gold, and now he’s the owner of Tesla and SpaceX, going around the world to attend meetings and conferences. His next plan is to start private trips to the moon. And HE...is an entrepreneur. </p>

                                    <p><strong>The Freedom</strong><br><br>Secondly, you have a lot of freedom to schedule your time. As an entrepreneur, you aren’t bound from 9am to 5pm. There’s a lot of work, but you schedule them to certain times of the day. You could go on a vacation and continue to work for a few hours a day. It all depends on you. Everything surrounds you. You’ll also have a sense of purpose in life, since you’ll be paid based on your performance, NOT based on your time. The better you perform, the more value you can generate. Especially if a business is up and running successfully, money will flow in very fast. Just saying, ladies also love men who are successful, if that’s what you’re interested in.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Wealth</strong><br><br>Thirdly, wealth. I’m not talking about being materialistic rich, although that comes along with being very wealthy. The wealth I am talking about is having a driven and focused mindset, never giving up, and that you’ll be fine in life whatever happens. No matter what how little money you have, or if you are broke, you know that one day you’ll be getting to the top with a nice limo and fancy suits, and of course, giving back to the community. It’s very rare to achieve a good amount of wealth and money through working a normal job. If you stop working, money stops flowing, and the harder you work, the wealthier your boss gets. Entrepreneurs, on the other hand, work for free.</p>

                                        And...this is our long term goal...To become make Woodberry the most unique and wealthiest high school in the world... Academically, it’s extremely hard to beat Exeter and Andover because of the history behind them. However, academic success doesn’t determine your financial wellbeing make after you graduate! We want Woodberry to be known as the cradle of young entrepreneurs, the ones that hire graduates of Exeter and Andover, and not become the academically successful specialists that work for others.<br><br>
                                        We’ll make Woodberry the most unique and wealthy High School through producing successful business students, who will then turn into successful Alumni, which brings in more donation and reputation, and the cycle repeats. It’ll get better each and every year, with more and more young man with good potential tuning in and help the school they love while learning about entrepreneurship and financial knowledge that’ll come in very handy after they graduate. Eventually, this will transform Woodberry as one of the top and the wealthiest High Schools in America.

                                    Many people today graduate from high school or college and have no idea how to manage or generate money, so they end of struggling with debt their whole lives, despite what kind of job they might have, and so our mission is to provide members with the experience and knowledge to deal with failure, and to seperate members from the average. When money comes, a member's first thought should be, how can I generate more value? How can I start a business and continue to manage it so that money keeps on flowing in. Members will be learning all sorts of useful tactics to help them thrive with a good lifestyle and provide work for themselves and others in the future.
