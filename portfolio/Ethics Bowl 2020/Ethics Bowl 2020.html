                                    Hey, this is some work I did with my team showcasing some different philosophies and approaches that we had to responding to some hard questions begged in December of 2020 for an ethics bowl tournament. Unfortunately we were only given 24 hours to prepare for this tournament, for it was a last minute call to invite our school to this tournament... However I led my team (I was the JV coach as a sophomore at the time), and I believe that we came up with some rather solid arguments...<br><br>
                                    In our team I primarily worked on: Dining Out During a Pandemic, The Korean Pop Industrial Complex, and Dating After Prison, however I ended up having to help across the board... Here is the case set we were given:

                                        We define factory farming as a form of necessary evil (Status Quo). Without factory farming most of us would not be able to afford meat. If we want to continue eating meat, factory farming is necessary. Although we believe that factory farming is a necessary evil, we understand that there are some more advantageous alternatives, such as plant based products. It would be irresponsible of us to quote on quote "cancel" or prohibit others from purchasing factory farming when such alternatives are not as widely accessable or as pronounced. We believe that overtime this necessary evil will become less necessary, and will eventually dissipate as other alternatives arise.

                                        National Security risk: TikTok poses a national security risk to the people of the United states as it regularly and willingly takes information from persons under the age of 8-9. The app’s main offensive danger is its gathering capabilities when it comes to personal information about some of the younger members of our community. “President” Xi Jinping has every right to demand that the data collected from aforementioned users be handed over to the chinese government. Seeing as the Chinese government and U.S. government have been trying to gain a hold over one another for the last 40 some odd years, giving the Chinese government access to the personal information of over 100 million American citizens poses a significant threat to the national security of this nation and its people.<br><br>
                                        Should we give up foreign products to protect National Security?: No, we should support the markets that these countries produce when the provide goods and or services that the average citizen deems necessary or wanted. To immediately shut off all trade with foriegn countries would be devastating to the opposing country, as well as to any American investors. Simply having the ability to do damage is not a reason to shut off an entire new market... If China was to enforce a will to damage America through the use of something like TikTok, only then would it be acceptable to shut down such a vast market. AKA weaponizing such a service.<br><br>
                                        Throughout this debate we are constantly going to cover the theme of China VS America, and the extreme disparity in motives...<br><br>
                                        It would be advantageous to connect TikTiok to Facebook, as they have somewhat similar capabilities... There have been reports of Facebook and TikTok being able to use a facial recognition software to not only recognize the user, but also the people in the background... It is unethical and an invasion of privacy for any social media to do something of the sorts... This kind of action is an ecroachment of privacy who have not willingly allowed this to happen, AKA for those who have not signed up. This also poses as a national security threat for high ranking government officials who wish to keep their location private...

                                        <strong>Our Final Team stance</strong><br><br>
                                        Individuals who wish to donate most certainly has a moral obligation to spend it wisely, and to donate in a program that has the highest effecieny in regards to effectiveness. That being said, they are by no means at fault if they are simply unaware of the ineffectiveness of one progream or another. Mary has no moral obligation to give money to either company, however she is morally obligated to not donate to Kiva, given the history of wastefullness and ineffectiveness of the program...<br><br>
                                        Prior to donating any individual should at least attempt to engage in some sort of research to know where their money is going... The individual who donates would in one way or another be complicit in the crimes or benefits of one program, and therefore must be aware of what is becoming of their donations. If she’s aware that a charity is harmful, she has a moral obligation not to donate to it.

                                        <strong>Our Final Team stance</strong><br><br>
                                        We really have to judge this one a case by case basis... There is no legislature that fits all schools or individuals... There are several benefits for either in class or online school. The easiest and most effective way of providing good education while maintaining a safe enviroment would be simply giving members of the school the choice as to whether or not they would like to teach/learn at school or at home... People are most effective in an enviroment in which they are comfortable... <br><br>
                                        That being said, all members of the community are still excpected to carry out any predisposed roles they had prior to Covid-19.<br><br>
                                        Nobody should be forced, as there is a significant risk of personal harm, and harm to others not immediately involved... If everyone was forced to go to school, the individuals who do not wish to be there will most likely act up, and make the school as a whole a less safe place to be...<br><br>
                                        It is also important to allow individuals to return to school for the sake of teaching members of the community who don't have access to good wifi, or to certain required online resources unlike those more fortunate than that individual.<br><br>
                                        Schools such as boarding school, and in isolated and rural communities not impacted by the pandemic may choose to resume in person learning if they can do so safely. However, they still should offer the opportunity to learn online, since there is always some risk of the virus being transmitted.<br><br>
                                        Schools should also have workers/volunteers work in the kitchen and outside and distribute the free meals that some unfortunate students may depend on.

                                        If we judge each individual down to the minute morals then there will never be a fully satisfied community. Not to mention there is no aformentioned definition of "good" or "bad"... No private owner of a building or object is obligated to change the name of their property... That being said, it would be in their own best interest if they were to do so. If one was to match the community's interest the individual may gain a better public opinion, which is beneficial in many ways...<br><br>
                                        Any public or communal space should be controlled by the scrutiny of the community... AKA, control the name of some property by a vote.

                                        <strong>Our Final Team stance</strong><br><br>
                                        It is absolutely ethical to to dine out during a pandemic... Eating out during a pandemic is the best way to support your local businesses. It helps waiters specifically, who would otherwise be unemployed due to the virus. If both the worker and the customer voluntarily serve each other, then there is no health violations being commited...
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>If it is voluntary then both sides have understood the possible dangers of the virus, and have come to the conclusion that the risk of unemployment outweighs the risk of contracting and or dying from the virus</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        The alternative to working would be unemployment, notoriously known for killing far more people than the virus is projected to kill. Maintaining a steady source of income is at utmost importance<br><br>
                                        What this truly comes down to is a disparity in values... Health/safety or income, neither more important or less important than the other. Individuals should have the ability to make their own decisions on how to manage their own body and life.<br><br>
                                        Megan and Andy do have a moral obligation to follow the CDC guidelines to keep themselves and others safe if they do plan on eating out.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Stay 6 feet apart</li>
                                            <li>Wear a mask</li>
                                            <li>Avoid hand-to-hand contact or contact with frequently touched surfaces</li>
                                            <li>Keep good hygiene </li>
                                        </ul>
                                        In regards to the balancing to the economy and the protection of health, I would leave all choices up to an individual to manage how to maanage their values. An individual knows his or her risks and values far better than a government that lives across the country.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>The issue with the government controlling the implementation of decisions is that they have to generalize the population and tend to the needs of the majority. Meanwhile “the left out” aren’t benefiting nearly as much, and sometimes are actually harmed. An individual can manage their needs more efficiently than anyone else can.</li>

                                        This comes down a lot to the views of an authoritarian vs the views of a libertarian.<br><br>

                                        Listeners have no moral obligation to stop supporting the k-pop industry if they are aware that performers are being mistreated. To begin with, assuming the company is not breaking any laws the workers voluntarily signed up to work, and are therefore at fault to any injustices. AKA, any harm imposed on the individual makes the indivudual equally at fault, if the mistreatment is bad to such a point, the individual should most certainly leave the company, howver the fact that they are staying means that it is in their own best interest. If we were to say "boycott" the company, it will effect the portrayers of evil, however it is most likely to negatively effect those who are the receivers of that evil more.<br><br>
                                        If people voluntarily enter contracts... No The worker voluntarily joined the company knowing that the terms of the contract are exploitative, and it is only due to the worker’s decision that they succumb to any of the owner’s commands... Let us take a look at two companies side by side. One is known for being exploitative and one isn’t. In every instance, the workers will file inline behind the company that is not exploitative.

                                        Up to the worker to decide whether or not he/she will stay/leave the sweatshop that produces the fast fashion. Boycotting would hurt those who choose to stay and would be inefficient at converting workers into considering other job prospects.<br><br>
                                        If you have the means to, it is moral not to purchase fast fashion. That being said, we wouldn't advocate for something along the lines of boycotting.

                                        <strong>Our Final Team stance</strong><br><br>
                                        The use of restorative disciplinary action on young children is just as desirable as the use of restorative action on adults. Restorative action on young children can be an excellent opportunity for them to learn and use empathy, while restorative action on adults is much more effective, given that most adults are familiar with hardship and have already learned to use empathy. If the offender is in some way unable to accept restorative action, then punitive action would have to be used.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Children often don’t know why what they’re doing is wrong. Punishment, therefore, may not be helpful if the child is unaware of why what they did was punishable, and, even if they know, can make them bitter. Schools should default to restorative justice on first offenses. However, if that doesn’t work, punitive justice is justified.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        Individual victims have no obligation to their offender (or at least no more than to any other person) if he chooses not to be obligated. Communities have an obligation to minimize harm to other community members. The obligation to offenders is stopping further offense while minimizing harm to the offender himself. (utilitarian). Therefore, the community (and the victim, if perceives it as his/her obligation) have the obligation to educate the offender of his offence so that further offences may be prevented.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>If a child is a offender, then instead of saying “he's just a child” you should say “this is a splendid opportunity for a lesson in empathy”</li>
                                            <li>If the offender is an adult, then extra effort must also be taken to divulge the motive of the offender, and whether or not it was intentional.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        Default to restorative, then go to punitive. Try to help the person, then try to stop the problem. If the offender committed the offence intentionally, with knowledge but no regard for the situation of the victim, then punitive action is recommended. However, if the act of offence was unintentional on the part of the offender, or if the offence was one of misinformation rather than ignorance/prejudice, then restorative action would be preferred.<br><br>
                                        Punitive punishment is the lazy solution to wrongdoing. It fixes the problem with coercion, which works under a specific set of circumstances, but doesn’t address the root of the issue. Some people, however, won’t listen to the excuse of “but it makes us feel bad,” no matter how hard we try. For those people who refuse to be helped, punishment is justified. If they won’t listen to reason, coercion will suffice. Help the person if you can, then stop the problem.<br><br>

                                        <strong>Our Final Team stance</strong><br><br>
                                        Antione and Jack should tell someone that they have been to jail once enough time passes to where the partner has the ability to think and make a decision in a cool headed environment and not forced to make assumptions based off of prejudiced and sudden revelations<br><br>
                                        We find no moral difference from Jack and Antione, for the life of the person’s past does not define who that person is today.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>2nd chances are always a possibility… The person who killed someone could be considered a “saint” now... whereas the person who was falsely accused could be engaged in unlawful acts today</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        The partner will likely be repelled simply by the label “ex-criminal” or “person who has gone to jail” and be unwilling to trust the person completely. If the person were to say “I was innocent however”, it could be seen as a lie and further worsen the impression. If the person were to say “I was in it because I committed xxx”, then it raises the trust but confirms and worsens the label. Unless given time to be digested, the person will likely not think clearly and empathetically.<br><br>
                                        In regards to friendships, it is by all means important to bring up, however the timing is still key, there is no need to bring it up the second you meet someone, although it would be in both of their self interests to bring it up or to have it brought up.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>It would be in the interest of the offender to tell his friend so the friend knows what he has dealt with and can help him</li>
                                            <li>It would be in the interest of the friend to know so he is aware of possible outcomes...</li>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Increased risk of abuse</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </ul>
                                        The answer would be the same. You would not want to tell a person you just met of your opinion on the state of the universe as a whole or your quirky feet fetish. If you were already good friends, the revelation may serve as a good laugh or lead to more understanding and bonding, but an immediate revelation would create a terrible first impression that negates any effort to bond.<br><br>
                                        Transparency, although delayed, is essential, and proven scientifically to be the most important trait in a relationship <strong><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-new-resilience/201208/is-radical-transparency-the-key-relationship-success">Here</a></strong>. By delaying transparency, you allow time to work through the quick but often erroneous immediate-decision-making part of your brain. It allows your partner to see you in a new light, to see things from your own perspective, something that only comes when a person is calm and in deep contemplation. It is common for couples to share and confide in each other’s troubles once they’re close, but almost no relationship lasts where the pair complains to each other from the start. It is impossible to know everything about the other person, but through understanding it can be easy to decipher their motives. It also allows your partner a 2nd chance.

                                        <strong>Our Final Team stance</strong><br><br>
                                        We do beilieve that it would be appropriate for a school(public school specifically) to implement policies that directly contradict some parents’ values or preferences if:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Based on facts, both statistical and anecdotal</li>
                                            <li>A majority of students and parents consider it tolerable/acceptable (caters to the general populus)</li>
                                            <li>Within the school’s ability to implement and enforce properly and completely</li>
                                            <li>Not against the law</li>
                                            <li>Will ultimately and realistically improve the school.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        The school, parent, and student all share equal responsibility in the education of the student in safe sex and the use of contraceptives. It is the parent’s duty to at least address and give the student some awareness of the importance of learning about safe sex principles and practices. It is the duty of the school to create an environment where receiving education on safe sex is not a shameful topic, but havign unsafe sex carries heavy stigma. It is therefore the duty of the student to educate himself/herself and his/her partner on the topic of having safe sex, and to always at least use contraceptives when performing intercourse.<br><br>
                                        The responsibility for a teenage pregnancy is shared first and foremost between the one who is pregnant and her partner. The circle of responsibility then extends to the one who is responsible for their education in the matter, whether that be their Health teacher or their parents. Next, the responsibility is shared by those who hold influence on the pair’s behavior, most notably their friend group and their extended family (or anyone else who might exert influence over their choice NOT to receive education regarding the matter). If rather than refusal, the pair lacked knowledge that education on the matter is available, then the blame is shared on the school for not giving them the opportunity. <br><br>

                                        <strong>Our Final Team stance</strong><br><br>
                                        As long as an idea does not incite violence or discrimination, no idea should be cancelled... It would be far more beeficial to society if we were to teach as opposed t shut down an individual based on one flawed opinion... You cannot necessarily blame an individual is the case of pure ignorance, especially if something was said without malicious intent.<br><br>
                                        Also, it is important to highlight the difference between a debate and speech, we believe that from every conversation there needs to be progression, not a winner or a loser, and denying the freedom of speech inherently disagrees with that claim. The solution to bad speech is not less speech, but more.<br><br>
                                        This does mean that bad speech will be heard but the best remedy to bad speech is more better speech. Flood the responses to a bad tweet or post with good information and good arguments. Like a bucket of water to a single candle.

                                        <strong>Our Final Team stance</strong><br><br>
                                        Reform, actually, has already been tried, even in the state where George Floyd himself was killed.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Minneapolis police implemented a series of training programs designed to professionalize policing, with the hope that it would reduce abuses.</li>
                                            <li>Officers were trained in how to respond to mental health crisis calls, how to de-escalate confrontations with the public, and how to be more self aware of racial bias. However, none of it worked.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        Furthermore, any attempts at resisting any sort of arrest, even if a suspect is innocent, is almost impossible due to a lack of an armed populace, and militarized police.<br><br>
                                        The police, at this point, with full support of the government, are really just a tool of use for the state to use against the people. A long, long history of police reformism exists in the United States, and inevitably, un-harsh, lazy police reform changes nothing. The institution is, no, not reformable to a degree that will make significant change. That being said, a complete and immediate reconstruction of the police could also prove to be catastrophic...<br><br>
                                        Obligation is really a subjective term. Should they, to bring in more support from the public? Of course. However, nobody is ‘obligated’ to do anything. Most activists who support the defundment of the police aren’t satisfied with reform, and are not obligated to change their views, no matter who disagrees with them. Activists, however, rather than making their views to the public more palatable to the public, should consider thinking of an alternative for community support, and law enforcement, if they do not want police. Therefore, obligation to make their demands more palatable is not necessary, rather, an explanation of their alternatives.

                                        The author of a book is by no means morally obligated to include specific political commentary.<br><br>
                                        "Jeannine Cummings took plenty of care in researching and discussing the topic of immigrants. Someone doesn’t have to be directly involved in something to properly talk about it. An author has no obligation to write about any topic a certain way. She chose not to engage in the political bickering of the subject because she wanted to talk about the human element of the issue. In ignoring the political aspect of the topic, she isn’t saying the politics isn’t important, she recognizes that, while many political views of the topic have been shared, the human impact is rarely talked about."

                                        Documentaries, if labeled as such, have an obligation to accurately portray reality. However, shows that inaccurately portray real characters are perfectly valid. If such a show exists, there must be a clear message of fiction, in order to not defame any individuals involved in the show. Anything that exaggerates reality or has any known bias should indicate such.

                                    Hey, this is some work I did with my team showcasing some different philosophies and approaches that we had to responding to some hard questions begged in December of 2020 for an ethics bowl tournament. Unfortunately we were only given 24 hours to prepare for this tournament, for it was a last minute call to invite our school to this tournament... However I led my team (I was the JV coach as a sophomore at the time), and I believe that we came up with some rather solid arguments...<br><br>
                                    In our team I primarily worked on: Dining Out During a Pandemic, The Korean Pop Industrial Complex, and Dating After Prison, however I ended up having to help across the board... Here is the case set we were given:
                                    <strong><a href="../Ethics Bowl 2020/ext/Case Set.pdf">Case Set</a></strong><br><br>
                                    <strong>DISCLAIMER</strong> The following research is only intended to be used for educational purposes. The following contentions shall not be used against me, as the files are only a testament to my dedication and are not effected by personal opinion (nor do they reflect my personal opinion), as the point of Ethics Bowl is to find a persuasive argument that is supported by morals and a value premise. Not necessarily to showcase any personal opinion. This also explains the incongruity of philosophies displayed on this page<br><br>
